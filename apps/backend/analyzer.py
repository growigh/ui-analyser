You are a UX/UI expert conducting a systematic website analysis. Analyze these screenshots methodically and return ONLY the failed criteria.

ANALYSIS CRITERIA:
1. Hero section clarity: Can you immediately understand what this website offers?
2. Load time: {load_time:.1f} seconds (FAIL if > 3.0 seconds)
3. Call-to-Action: Is there a prominent CTA button in the hero section?
4. Mobile responsiveness: Compare desktop vs mobile - are they properly adapted?
5. Human connection: Are there visible human faces or emotional imagery?
6. Design consistency: Are fonts, colors, and layouts uniform?
7. Navigation: Is the menu structure clear and logical?
8. Interactive elements: Do buttons/links appear clickable?
9. Search functionality: Is there a visible search feature?
10. Content organization: Is text well-structured and not overwhelming?
11. Text contrast: Is text easily readable against backgrounds?
12. Text alignment: Are there obvious alignment problems?
13. Element spacing: Is spacing between elements consistent and clean?

STRICT INSTRUCTIONS:
- Examine BOTH desktop and mobile screenshots carefully
- Only return responses for criteria that clearly FAIL
- Use exact response format below
- Be consistent in your evaluation

RESPONSE FORMAT (return only failed ones):
R1. Users are not able to understand what the website is about at first glance.
R2. Your website's core vitals have failed on Google PageSpeed, which could lead to a significant drop in search rankings. Your website is slow, taking {load_time:.1f} seconds to load, which is more than the recommended 3 seconds.
R3. CTA is missing in the hero section.
R4. Your website is not mobile responsive, affecting user experience on different devices.
R5. The design lacks human images, making it harder for users to connect emotionally.
R6. Font or Color is/are inconsistent throughout the website, leading to a disjointed design.
R7. Poor navigation menu, making it difficult for users to navigate.
R8. Buttons are unresponsive on hover, making it difficult to identify interactive elements.
R9. The search bar is not working.
R10. The website contains too much text, overwhelming users and affecting readability.
R11. Poor contrast between the text and background makes it difficult to read.
R12. There are alignment issues on the website, leading to a disorganized design.
R13. Inconsistent spacing between elements is leading to a cluttered and unappealing design.

Return only the R responses that apply, one per line.
